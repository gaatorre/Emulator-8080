# Emulator-8080
I embarked on creating an Intel 8080 emulator during the summer of 2017. I followed the tutorial at the following site: http://www.emulator101.com/full-8080-emulation.html.

I wanted to prepare myself for my University's computer system course, which would be my first introduction to the lower levels of computing. Thus, I implemented most of the instructions in the ISA to get a feel for what a simple proccessor does when it executes certain commands. It certainly helped as I recieved an A in the class.
